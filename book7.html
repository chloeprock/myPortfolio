      <h3>* Project Overview *</h3>
      <p>
        Assisted experts at The Visual Agency with data analysis on bird migration patterns for Terna, an Italian energy company. During my process of analysis, I created these glyph-based visualizations of the data. 
        Click <a href="https://www.terna.it/it/progetti-territorio/avifauna/tutti-dati-sorvoli">here</a> to view the data on Terna's website.
      </p> <br> <br> 

      <h3>* Project Process *</h3>
      <p>I created a pair of visualizations for this data; one for each data collection location. I used a birds wing structure as the glyph, with the feathers representing the number of birds for each species and the color of the bone showing the vulnerability of the species. Each species is then organized into a group showing the family they belong to. The goal of the visualization was to assist the viewer in quickly identifying: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              the bird species passing through location in the highest numbers
            </li>
            <li> 
              the rare bird species passing through location
            </li>
          </ul>
