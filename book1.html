        <h3>* Project Overview *</h3>
        <p>
          This project explores the relationship between the capitalist system and its implications for climate change. 
          The foundational concepts stem from a critical examination of the capitalist drive for profit-making, 
          perpetual consumption patterns, inequity between citizens from developing and developed economies, 
          and the implications of these factors on the growing climate crisis. We draw from the work of H.A Baer, 
          which illuminates the impact of the capitalist ideology on perpetuating fossil fuel reliance and greenhouse gas emissions: 

          <br>
          <br> 
          
          “In an increasingly globalized economic system, the capitalist drive for profit making and economic expansion results in 
          a perpetual treadmill of production and consumption heavily reliant on fossil fuels and other substances that produce 
          greenhouse gas emissions.” [1]. 

          <br>
          <br>

          We leverage data from the World Bank on greenhouse gas emissions per capita [2], and the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) [3]. 
          The CRI is a weighted index of 4 measures used to evaluate the losses a country has experienced from extreme weather events connected to climate change.
          The losses analyzed are economic losses (absolute losses of purchasing power parity, and losses per GDP unit), and loss of life (number of lives lost, 
          and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants).

        <h3>* Project Process and Methodology *</h3>

        <p>
          The project was created in processing using particle systems and a physics library to simulate realistic hurricane behavior. 
          Particles leave short trails and have a centrifugal motion: rotating closer to the center than in the outer rim. The hurricanes 
          have different eye sizes, total sizes, and speeds based on data values. For very at-risk countries, you would see a large hurricane 
          with a small eye rotating quickly. This mimics the true behavior of hurricanes, where smaller eyes signify greater intensity and 
          faster rotation indicates stronger winds. The particles extinguish when they reach the eye of the hurricane, and then are reseeded 
          in the periphery. The outward motion of the emissions ring nods to the idea of emissions expanding from their source and diffusing 
          into the atmosphere. We color-coded the hurricane and the ring for clarity: CRI is shown in blue, and GHG in red. 
        
          <br>
          <br>

          Ultimately, we aim to depict this metaphorical representation of climate vulnerabilities juxtaposed with global greenhouse gas emissions 
          to shed light on the relationship between risk and emissions at the country-level granularity. Many nations with low GHG emissions have 
          and will continue to experience destructive climate events that they did not cause. High-emitting nations should be held responsible for 
          climate damages in low-emitting nations, and many high-emitting nations can afford to. But, for high emitters, while pollution has historically
          been something to bury or ship away, climate risk cannot be exported. The impacts of high emissions reverberate globally, regardless of the source,
          in increasingly unpredictable and destructive ways.
