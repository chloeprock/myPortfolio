                <p>
                  This calendar is a data visualization based product. It shows all the plants that can be grown, the months they should be planted, and the planting actions you can take to grow those plants in Boston, MA (USA Climate Zone 7A). 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The data comes from Gardenate.com, a general reference planting guide for home gardeners.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The intended purpose of this project was to create a visualization that could assist the user in learning how and when to plant specific vegetables, herbs, and edible flowers for the kitchen garden.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A user who may be interested in this calendar is a beginner gardener in Boston who wants to have a reference guide for when, what, and how to plant for their specific climate zone. The data visualization improves upon existing formats for understanding this information, such as the Gardenate website.

              <h3>*Designing the Glyphs*</h3>

              <p>The data point for each plant is represented in a glyph notation. The main circle is the plant, colored with the associated planting action for that month. Around the edges of the main circle are the other months with an associated planting action. 
              </p>
                <br> <br> 
                
                <div class="side-by-side">

                    On the right is my initial sketch of this concept, and below are snapshots from the final key that appears in the calendar.

                <h3>* Implementation *</h3>
                <p>In order to implement this glyph for the data that I had, I wrote some code in processing. 
                  I set inventory for the months and the planting actions. 
                  Then, I extracted that information from my data and created two arrays. I drew the main circles, and then finally, I created a helper function "drawCircles" in order to draw the additional circles that form the glyph.  
                  My output from processing looked like this: 
                </p>
                <img class="gallery-img" src="/myPortfolio/imgs/plantingCalender/output.png">

                <br> <br>

                <p>I then split the glyphs I had generated into a grid for each month of the calendar: </p>
                <img class="gallery-img" src="/myPortfolio/imgs/plantingCalender/prototype1.png" id="prototype-img1">

                <br> <br> 
                <p>In early iterations of the design, the key appeared only in the introductory pages of the calendar. However, after testing this design in print, it became clear that this would make for a dysfunctional design. It is necessary to have the key to decode the meaning of the planting action colors, as it is too many unique values for a user to hold in their working memory.
                  With the first iterations of the design, the user would have to be constantly flipping back and forth between the month and the key page at the beginning to repeat Cognitive Task/Visual Query #3. This becomes even more frustrating if the calendar is pinned up on the wall, as to flip back to the beginning to see the key you would have to completely remove the calendar from the wall.
                  To solve this issue, I added an additional instance of the planting action key along the bottom of the last page, so that no matter what page of the calendar you are on, you can quickly decode the meaning of each color hue without having to remember 9 unique colors hues + their assigned planting action.
                </p>

                <p>This project is the culmination of a years worth of research, photography, and design work. To fulfill my degree in Graphic and Information Design at Northeastern, I was required to complete a degree project of my choosing. The degree project is a self-directed project that takes place over the course of two semesters. The first semester consists of exploration of potential topics, while the second semester consists of creating the final deliverable for the chosen topic. 
                  <br> <br>
                  During the first semester, I did initial research around local issues relevant to my interest in using information design and data visualization as a way to explore sustainability related issues, during which an article in the Boston Globe "As landfill space in dwindles in Massachusetts, New Hampshire has become the state's dumping ground" became the catalyst for my discovery of the complex issue of waste systems. Using news articles, information available from Massachusetts waste datasets, and land history reports as a guide, I conducted field visits to local waste disposal sites. Each visit expanded my understanding of the site far beyond what the data alone revealed. 
                  <br> <br> 
                  In addition to the second semester degree project course I took to receive direction and critiques on the book layout, structure, and design, I also completed a graduate level independent research-study with Dietmar Offenhuber, who is an expert in looking at waste systems from a design perspective. The expertise Professor Offenhuber was able to provide, and the guidance he brought around my research process proved to be essential to the final content of the book.

              <p>
                Assisted experts at The Visual Agency with data analysis on bird migration patterns for Terna, an Italian energy company. During my process of analysis, I created these glyph-based visualizations of the data. 
                Click <a href="https://www.terna.it/it/progetti-territorio/avifauna/tutti-dati-sorvoli">here</a> to view the data on Terna's website.
              </p> <br> <br> 

              <h3>* Project Process *</h3>
              <p>I created a pair of visualizations for this data; one for each data collection location. I used a birds wing structure as the glyph, with the feathers representing the number of birds for each species and the color of the bone showing the vulnerability of the species. Each species is then organized into a group showing the family they belong to. The goal of the visualization was to assist the viewer in quickly identifying: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      the bird species passing through location in the highest numbers
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                      the rare bird species passing through location
                    </li>
                  </ul>
