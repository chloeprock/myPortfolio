      <h3>* Project Overview *</h3>

      <p>This project is the culmination of a years worth of research, photography, and design work. To fulfill my degree in Graphic and Information Design at Northeastern, I was required to complete a degree project of my choosing. The degree project is a self-directed project that takes place over the course of two semesters. The first semester consists of exploration of potential topics, while the second semester consists of creating the final deliverable for the chosen topic. 
        <br> <br>
        During the first semester, I did initial research around local issues relevant to my interest in using information design and data visualization as a way to explore sustainability related issues, during which an article in the Boston Globe "As landfill space in dwindles in Massachusetts, New Hampshire has become the state's dumping ground" became the catalyst for my discovery of the complex issue of waste systems. Using news articles, information available from Massachusetts waste datasets, and land history reports as a guide, I conducted field visits to local waste disposal sites. Each visit expanded my understanding of the site far beyond what the data alone revealed. 
        <br> <br> 
        In addition to the second semester degree project course I took to receive direction and critiques on the book layout, structure, and design, I also completed a graduate level independent research-study with Dietmar Offenhuber, who is an expert in looking at waste systems from a design perspective. The expertise Professor Offenhuber was able to provide, and the guidance he brought around my research process proved to be essential to the final content of the book.
